StackSight DAO 👁️

Bitcoin-Secured DAO Transparency on Stacks

StackSight DAO is a read-only Web3 dashboard that allows anyone to view DAO treasuries and governance proposals on the Stacks blockchain, anchored to Bitcoin security.

No wallet connection. No transactions. Just clarity.

🚀 Overview

DAOs promise transparency, but most users can’t easily see:

How much money a DAO controls

What proposals exist

How votes are distributed

StackSight DAO solves this by providing a simple, clean interface to explore DAO data directly from the Stacks blockchain.

🎯 Problem

DAO treasury data is public but hard to access

Governance contracts are not user-friendly

Non-technical users struggle to understand on-chain governance
